# Twitter-Bots
Code for the Twitter bots I make.
### DarApproved
This bot replies to everything I tweet with [this picture](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/734598361546948613/wPXqjtzL.jpg).
### Dawg
This is a bot I used to create a parody account of a specific Twitter user. Right now, the bot simply copy/pastes the tweet, adding "Yo," at the beginning and "Dawg out. \*drops mic\*" at the end. I plan on one day creating a more complex system to replace text within the tweet, but for now it is still very simple. Because this was made to interact with a specific Twitter account that is not mine, I have changed any lines of code that may have contained any personal information of that person to be more generic.
